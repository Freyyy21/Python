#Variables
#Variables are containers for storing data values.

#Creating Variables
#Python has no command for declaring data values'
#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it
#Example
x = 5
y = "John Crammer"
print(x)
print(y)

#Casting
#If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
#Example
x = str(3)
y = int(3)
z = float(3)

#Get the type
#You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
#Example
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
